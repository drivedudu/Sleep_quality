## Project Intro
The quality of children's sleep is essential for maternal development and well-being. 
Let's explore how sleep practices and emotional factors interact.


### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Data exploration/descriptive statistics
* Data processing/cleaning


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib

## Project Description
Data was collected between June and September 2020.

This project analyzes the influence of maternal mental health on infant sleep quality. Using data on sleep methods, anxiety, stress, and postpartum depression symptoms, we investigate the prevalence of emotional disorders in mothers and their impact on infant sleep. The analysis includes identifying percentages of mothers with different mental health conditions and the distribution of sleep methods, providing valuable insights for health interventions.

### Questions and Hypotheses:

1.  **Temporal Trend Hypothesis:** Investigating if aviation safety has improved over time, evidenced by a decrease in accident frequency.

2. **Location Hypothesis:** Examining if certain geographic regions have a higher incidence of accidents due to factors like population density, geographical conditions, or specific climatic characteristics.
3. **Weather Factors Hypothesis:** Analyzing if adverse weather conditions correlate with increased aviation accidents, such as fog, storms, or strong winds.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
Utilizing tables and graphs to analyze trends over time and geographical patterns. Statistical methods will be employed to test hypotheses, including regression analysis for temporal trends and correlation analysis for weather factors.

-- **Blockers and Challenges:**

* Ensuring data quality and consistency across decades and regions.
* Dealing with missing or incomplete data, especially in earlier years.
* Handling complex interactions between multiple variables, such as weather and geographic factors.

This project aims to assess the effectiveness of safety protocols implemented over the years and identify areas for improvement to further enhance aviation safety.

### Main Question

**How Do Sleeping Methods Influence Babies' Sleep Quality and Maternal Well-Being?**

### Conclusion

The analysis revealed that maternal mental health, particularly high levels of anxiety and postpartum depression symptoms, significantly impacts the quality of infant sleep. Mothers reporting higher anxiety levels and postpartum depression symptoms tend to have infants with more frequent night wakings and shorter sleep duration. Various sleep methods show different levels of effectiveness, but the correlation with maternal mental health is consistent, highlighting the importance of providing adequate mental health support to mothers to promote better sleep outcomes for infants.
